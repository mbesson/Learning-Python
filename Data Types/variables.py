# Now, let's have fun with variables. 

myName = 'Mathieu' # Assignement

myName # It is a named value

# We can use the print 
print(myName) # Don't forget, sinc it it a sting that it is imutable. 

myName += ' Besson'
myName

my_str = 'Math'
my_int = 1 # there is no lock on types!!!!

my_str = my_int
my_str
my_int = 4
my_str

#There is different scoopings!
# If a variable is refernce somewhere, it doasn't mean it is available everywhere in your program
